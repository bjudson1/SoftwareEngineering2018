1) To implement a second traintrack I edited the MapBuilder to generate 2 
tracks. However, this meant I had to make the gates observers of both trains
so that the logic could be based off the location of both trains. I also had to
add a simple indicator variable telling the direction of a train in a train 
class. I liked my implementation for the first part because I think my simple
solution if effective enough. I thought about adding additional states but
this solution is cleaner in my opinion. I implemented the crossing cars by
having the east car factory randomy assign some cars to cross with a indicator
variable. Then if it is a crossing car the logic in move() is handled
accordingly. I think a better implementation would have been to keep lists of 
cars that are on the various roads and switch the cars between these lists 
depending on the location of the car. 

2) I think my implementaion for the first part would scale decently well.
However, the gate logic would have be changed with each additional track. We
could instead generate a list of tracks and traverse this list when evaluating
gate logic. I think my implementation for the second part will not scale very
well ecspecially if there were multiple crossing roads. In order to make it
scale better I could give the cars information on what road they are on to
help them decide how to move. A seperate apporach would be to make a list
of cars for each road and then traverse the cars in this list and handle the
movement.
