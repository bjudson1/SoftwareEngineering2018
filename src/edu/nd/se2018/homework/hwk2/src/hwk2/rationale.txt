Design Rational Reflection

I decided to implement the horse race using the strategy pattern. This pattern
allows us to nicely handle the variations in the various racing strategies by
making them share a common interface. We are designing to an interface not an
implementation. I also have a race class that adds horses (another class)
and has a function to start the race. There is also be a main class that 
creates and starts the race.
