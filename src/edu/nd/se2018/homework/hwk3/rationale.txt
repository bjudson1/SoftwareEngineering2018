Design Rational Reflection

I decided to implement the ocean explorer game using the observer pattern. To do
this I decided to implement a ship class as the observable class and a pirate
ship class that observes the ship class. This pattern allows the pirate ship to
recieve updates from the ship and react to it's movements. Also, because both
priate ship and ships need to have an understanding of the map to navigate the
game, I decided to give them both an instance of the map in their constructors.
Wrapping this all together is the OceanExplorer class which acts as the main 
controller for this project.
